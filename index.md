Hi, I'm Musaitha Basheer, a Software Engineering student at the Open University of Sri Lanka. I have a strong passion for developing web applications and exploring the vast possibilities of the digital world.

 When I'm not coding, you'll often find me immersed in the world of literature, enjoying the beauty of books. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm excited to showcase my work and skills on this portfolio website.
